This is a SVN version of Spydroid (http://code.google.com/p/spydroid-ipcamera/) from July 3, 2012 with FFMPEG for Android (https://github.com/guardianproject/android-ffmpeg).   The following code has been added to SpydroidActivity.java:

    	// Runnable for FFMPEG    
    	Runnable runProcessVideo = new Runnable () {
    		public void run ()
    		{
    			try
    			{
					if (ffmpeg == null)
					{
						ffmpeg = new FFMPEGWrapper(SpydroidActivity.this.getBaseContext());
					}

    				String url = "rtsp://" + "127.0.0.1" + ":8086/?h264=500-30-720-480";
    				ffmpeg.processVideo(url);
    					
    			}
    			catch (Exception e)
    			{
    				Log.e(TAG,"error with ffmpeg",e);
    			}
    		}
    	};   
    		
		// Create Thread for FFMPEG
    	Thread thread = new Thread(runProcessVideo);
    	//thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
    	thread.start();    	

A couple of classes (BinaryInstaller.java, FFMPEGWapper.java, ShellUtils.java) have been taken from SSCVideoProto (https://github.com/guardianproject/SSCVideoProto/) to aid with utilizing FFMPEG.

Within FFMPEGWrapper.java, a bunch of unnessecary code has been stripped out and the main ffmpegCommand has been changed to this:

String[] ffmpegCommand = {ffmpegBin, "-v", "10",    			
    			"-i", url,
    			"-f", "rtsp",
    			"-muxdelay", "0.1",
    			"-acodec", "copy",
				"-vcodec", "copy", 
				"rtsp://live:live@192.168.1.9:1935/live/fromphone.sdp"
    	};

This sends the video from Spydroid to an RTSP server on 192.168.1.9 (a Wowza Media Server).
